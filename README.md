# Braille-recognition-preprocessing
Braille recognition preprocessing is the first part of braille recognition. The content is to collect and segment image information into individual braille characters for output, which can then be used as input for braille recognition and output results. For the research of this project, the team chose python language and opencv image processing tool. The project identified several preprocessing steps during the experiment, including Braille image acquisition, image processing, image segmentation and output. For each part, different schemes were prepared and studied separately, tested, and the scheme with better performance was selected and optimized. Finally, the obtained program can use a computer or mobile phone camera to collect images; the shooting conditions are relatively loose, and a rotation error of plus and minus 30 degrees is allowed for the taken pictures; the obtained results are of the same size and can be specified in size, and the pictures are clear and completely acceptable. Meet the requirements for Braille recognition.
